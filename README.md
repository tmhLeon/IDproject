# The Game
The game works by feeding our cat, Garfeldi. Users get one(1) daily lasagna, and will use it to feed Garfeldi.
For every lasagna fed, the player gets a $1 voucher.
Lasagna does not stack. That means if the user misses a day, the daily lasagna count will not go beyond 1.

# Dev Notes
We plan to make a ecommerce website based on Lazada but we changed the flower-watering game and converted it to a virtual pet game 
where it will be more engaging for the users. The virtual pet will be a purple Garfield which it eats lasagna to give a $1 voucher.
The lasagna will be replenished daily and if the user missed a day, the lasagna will not be over 1.
